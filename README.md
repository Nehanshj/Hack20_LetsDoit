# LETs DO IT

Reward Based Task Management Application built purely with Flutter

## Details

Our application "Let's DO-it" is based on the theme, 'Save the Planet/What We've Learned from the Pandemic'.
During the pandemic when the whole world is at a standstill, it's difficult to be productive, not procrastinate, utilise the natural resources wisely, and most of all be aware of our actions and not harm the environment.

Our application is a modified and sleek version of a simple ToDo application which aims to all of this by helping its users enter a productive and environment friendly lifestyle by selecting different tasks from a whole bunch of pre-listed and modifiable tasks therefore rewarding them with BADGES and increase in levels as they completes their tasks.

User is supposed to compelte a minimum number of tasks from the sections (Personal, Environmental, Special) in order to earn a badge.
